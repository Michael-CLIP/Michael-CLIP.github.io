<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an undergraduate student in computer science at the [University of Minnesota Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I transferred from the [Beijing University of Chemical Technology](https://www.buct.edu.cn/main.html), where I studied computer science for two years. I am also a visiting student at the [HCP Laboratory of Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu-hcp.net/).

Previously, my research interests were in learning with noisy labels, semi-supervised learning, and test-time adaptation. My current research interests include multimodal large models, reinforcement learning—particularly in video understanding—and reasoning in large language models.

Mitigating Cache Noise in Test-Time Adaptation for Large Vision-Language Models

Also accepted at ICLR 2025 FM-Wild Workshop</span>

*We propose CRG—a zero-shot TTA method that uses learnable residuals to align visual and text prototypes and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis to model class distributions, boosting vision-language models’ robustness under distribution shifts.*
